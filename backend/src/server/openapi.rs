Network topology discovery and visualization API.

## Authentication

Two authentication methods are supported:

| Method | Header | Use Case |
|--------|--------|----------|
| User API key | `Authorization: Bearer scp_u_...` | Programmatic access, integrations |
| Session cookie | `Cookie: session_id=...` | Web UI (via `/api/auth/login`) |

User API keys require your organization to have API access enabled. Create keys at **Platform > API Keys**.

## Rate Limiting

Limit: 300 requests/minute

Burst: 150

Response headers: `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset`

When rate limited, you'll receive HTTP `429 Too Many Requests` with a `Retry-After` header.

## Response Format

All responses use a standard envelope:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": { ... },
  "meta": {
    "api_version": 1,
    "server_version": "0.12.10"
  }
}
```

Error responses include an `error` field instead of `data`:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Resource not found",
  "meta": { ... }
}
```

**Common status codes:** `400` validation error, `401` unauthorized, `403` forbidden, `404` not found, `409` conflict, `429` rate limited.

## Versioning

The API version is an integer (`api_version: 1`) incremented only on breaking changes. API is versioned independently from the application. Endpoints are prefixed with `/api/v1/`. Check `GET /api/version` for current versions.

## Multi-Tenancy

Resources are scoped to your **organization** and **network(s)**:

- You can only access entities within your organization
- Network-level entities (hosts, services, etc.) are filtered to networks you have access to
- Use `?network_id=<UUID>` to filter list endpoints to a specific network
- API keys can be scoped to a subset of your accessible networks
